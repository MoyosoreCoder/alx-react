#React inline styling project

Task 0
Copy over the task_5 directory from the 0x04. React components project (We’ll be using it as the base for this project)
Rename the task_5 directory to task_0
Modify the CourseListRow component in task_0/dashboard/src/CourseList/CourseListRow.js:

Using inline styling, change the background color of a row to #f5f5f5ab
Using inline styling, change the background color of a header row to #deb5b545
If needed, modify the test file so every test pass
Tips:

For better performances, never create and pass an object to an element directly. Use a constant instead
Use the isHeader prop to easily pick the style you want to apply to the tr tag
Requirement:

Even if the modification is small, make sure that your test suites are still passing. Especially the file CourseListRow.test.js
